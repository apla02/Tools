# Scrum the basics

> - The scrum approach allows teams  to deliver a milestones as small pieces.

>- To the project team the goal is to make the project done.

>- Agile project management allows a team to adapt to change in real time .

### AGILE MANIFESTO
> We are uncovering better ways of  developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
>- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
 >- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
 >- **Responding to change** over following a plan
 #### That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

 ### TWELVE PRINCIPLES OF AGILE SOFTWARE
 > -Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of  valuable software.
 > -Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
 >- Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
 > -Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of  weeks to a couple of  months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
 >- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
 >- Build projects around motivated individuals. 
 >- Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
 >- The most efficient and effective method of  conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
 >- Working software is the primary measure of  progress.
 >- Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
 >- The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
 >- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
 >- Simplicity – the art of  maximizing the amount of  work not done – is essential.
 >- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
 >- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.




Why does the Agile method allow teams to self-organize?
> They will do a much better job working on the design and tests from the ground level, rather than from an up-front plan.

Feedback
> Self-organization is an overriding theme of the Agile Manifesto, which makes it unique to software development methodologies.


How are the basics of the Scrum framework designed to encourage a fast feedback loop?
> by encouraging small-scale focus and rapid learning cycles

Feedback

The short time frame and a focus on a completed product at the end forces the team to fail and learn fast.

Roles
### Product owner
>- Bussines representive of team. They contrbuiting through the product every day
>- Reviews of the team's work
>- Ensure the highest value is delivered
>- Interact with the stakeholders
>- Mantain the scope of the product vision

Scrum Master
>- Protect the team, protect the process
>- Keep the team working at sutainable pace
>- Act as spokesperson for the team
>- Helps remove any blockmap

Stablish your scrum team
>- colaboration and communication tips
>- Ensure you are dedicated team
>- No multitasking
>- Ideal 7 members at least 2
>- Includes team members with T-shaped skills (Deep an crossed discipline expertise)

time, cost, scope are the three normal constraints


Product vision
>- Stablished by the product owner
>- MVP: Allows for a fast feedback loop
>- Reduces a scoop creep
>- Helps busy professionals to have more time  by providing a mobile app

Example themes
>- Separate the themes

User  stories
tactical level of work to do quickly
usually are done by the P.O
> - I ndependt
> - N egociable
> - V aluable
> - E stimable
> - S mall (should be done in one sprint)
> - T estable

Acceptance criteria
> the most powerful tool that team has, each story has a unique AC, E.g name, email, description

Create bounduries

Backlog refinerement
> Priorize the stories

stablish your sprint
> Try a 2 weeks sprint cadence

Use story points to convey relative sizes

Roadmap
> guide showing when themes will be  worked on during a time frame

Release
> To provide visibility

Stabilized visibility
> 10 points por sprint * 3 number of sprint = 30 points to release

Sprint planning meeting
>- understand the story and acceptance criteria
>- Post the definition of done
>- Plan for a question and answer session

Information Radiation : post visibles on the walls
>- Project vision
>- Team norms
>- Team's definition of done
>- roadmap
>- Release plan

>- Task board: task status
>- Sprint burndown task

Standup meeting: daily meeting
>- Collaboration
>- Communication
>- Cadence

>- 15 minutes



Why is a backlog refinement event usually held around midpoint of the Sprint?
> to evaluate what new items have come up



Before verifying the team has the capacity to complete the work, what do you need to know?
> hours for all the planned work in the Sprint
